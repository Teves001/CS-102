"4","Phantom Thread","sheyda22","26 January 2019","10/10","Daniel Day-Lewis BEST act to date","This is a movie for old souls. This is not a slow movie as some has written. I believe that it´s intention was to let you be a guest there in real time and feel all the natural pauses that happens in life, bathing in Daniel Day-Lewis beautiful rhythm. And how well the older Daniel meshed with the younger Vicky in a poetic tango.Daniel Day-Lewis has said that this would be His last film, and if that is so, then He leaved after laying down His ACE.Someone compared this to Bitter Moon. I don´t agree. The couples had different obstacles, and the other movie was as the title: bitter.
This movie is art and one should see it with only one expectation
  Daniel Day-Lewis will deliver GOLD."

"9","Puss in Boots","gaheheg","21 March 2023","10/10","A Dreamworks Masterpiece","Do you like anime, because I do, and by god is this the most anime-like American animated movie Ive seen. The way it does smooth action and atmosphere as well as intricate character moments reminds me a lot of series Ive watched with a lot more detail and time. Not only do the messages and themes resonate, but the portrayals are done surprisingly well of things like anxiety, fear of death, etc etc. I know that animated childrens movies can execute these well, but this takes it to another level for me while having exhilarating animelike fight scenes. Theyre on another level for something out of dreamworks, compare it to the Shrek scene where hes fighting some of Farquads goons and its like night and day. Anyways, give this a watch, one of the best animated films in a fat minute."
"10","Saltburn","aboalhyjaa","23 December 2023","8/10","Peak parody, or is it","Saltburn is a captivating movie to watch and its a fun ride, the mixture of you thinking you have figured it out and then knowing that you didnt make the experience a whole lot better!Watching this movie i thought Its a social commentary on the British royal life, or thats what I thought. After the first half of the movie went by I started to notice where this movie was gonna go. And to be honest i wasnt thrilled about my prediction because if it were true then its just a basic story with an amazing cast to do it. Well, as it turns out it was a mix of both.The writing was great, the acting was even greater, the filming provided a whole other thing to the plate as it was also amazing, and the saltburn castle alone is just an amazing place.The ending did not in fact pleased me, it felt a bit rushed. But as always what saved the day wad the great performance of Barry Keoghan"
